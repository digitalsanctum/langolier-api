Wow. I write about my own projects, but also tech in general based on my current interests, which at the moment are around Rust, Bazel (again), and Unix systems in general.\nIt's interesting how the blog has changed: I used to write short posts almost daily describing whatever I had been tinkering with in open source projects (back when I contributed to NetBSD and Gnome regularly)... or whatever crossed my mind really. These days, most of those misc posts go into social media, and the blog is reserved for purposeful articles, which end up being much longer (and thus infrequent).\nCommenting on the blog used to be much more common years ago, but these days discussion happen off-site in either social media or here. Similarly, people used to visit the blog periodically, but these days nobody does: traffic to the blog is either from organic searches or from spikes due to referrals from sites like HN.\nAs for how I build it: the posts are written in Markdown; I use Hugo to generate the site; Bootstrap for styling; and my custom web service (EndTRACKER) to offer email subscriptions, post voting and commenting, as well as privacy-respecting analytics.",

Going over a random lemma from Newton's Principia [https://oktagonia.github.io/blog/lemma14/lemma14.html]\n2. Encoding ternary logic into the lambda calculus (I previously posted on HN) [https://oktagonia.github.io/blog/ternary/ternary.html]\n3. Some epistemological ideas (tbh this is not very good and I intend to write a better post about this stuff soon) [https://oktagonia.github.io/blog/pragsol/p.html]\nI hope you guys enjoy and give me some feedback if you got some.",

It's still a WIP draft, quite rough around the edges and not ready for prime-time, but you only have that kind of Ask HN thread once (every couple of years I assume).\nSide-note: the Google and Bing webcrawlers managed to find and index that domain name despite having no public links to it whatsoever (to my knowledge) until now, my only logical explanation is that they've found it by scrapping the WHOIS database. It's also hosted inside my home on my personal Synology DS218 NAS with a rather dodgy setup, which will probably crash and burn under any level of load by the time you've read this comment.\n[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35729232\n[2] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35738758",

TL;DR: SSH tricks to turn SQLite into a networked DB.\nhttps://ricardoanderegg.com/posts/sqlite-remote-explorer-gui...\n- Using SQLite for logging and ad-hoc profiling (SQLite is a powerful JSON database!)\nhttps://ricardoanderegg.com/posts/sqlite-logging-profiling-p...\n- Learning about Bloom Filters by creating one. There are a ton of posts about implementing a bloom filter, but it was super fun to write one from scratch.\nhttps://ricardoanderegg.com/posts/understanding-bloom-filter...\nAnd my favourite one:\n- Heroku-style deployments with Docker and git tags. I tried to create a deployment system where I could just `git push production`. It covers a bit of everything, git, docker, Caddy, blue-green deployments, git hooks, curl, etc.\nhttps://ricardoanderegg.com/posts/git-push-deployments-docke...",
